### Deep Learning Project!

In this project, i built a regression model using the Keras library to model  data about concrete compressive strength.

1. Concrete Data:
the data can be found here : 
https://cocl.us/concrete_data

the predictors in the data of concrete strength include:

Cement

Blast Furnace Slag

Fly Ash

Water

Superplasticizer

Coarse Aggregate

Fine Aggregate

2. i  experimented with increasing the number of training epochs and changing number of hidden layers to see how changing these parameters impacts the performance of the model.
